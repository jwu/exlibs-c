/**
 * SECTION:cogl-display
 * @short_description: Represents a display pipeline
 *
 * TODO: We still need to decide if we really need this object or if
 * it's enough to just have the CoglSwapChain CoglOnscreenTemplate
 * objects.
 *
 * The basic intention is for this object to let the application
 * specify its display preferences before creating a context, and
 * there are a few different aspects to this...
 *
 * Firstly there is the physical display pipeline that is currently
 * being used including the digital to analogue conversion hardware
 * and the screen the user sees. Although we don't have a plan to
 * expose all the advanced features of arbitrary display hardware with
 * a Cogl API, some backends may want to expose limited control over
 * this hardware via Cogl and simpler features like providing a list
 * of modes to choose from in a UI could be nice too.
 *
 * Another aspect is that the display configuration may be tightly
 * related to how onscreen framebuffers should be configured. In fact
 * one of the early rationals for this object was to let us handle
 * GLX's requirement that framebuffers must be "compatible" with the
 * fbconfig associated with the current context meaning we have to
 * force the user to describe how they would like to create their
 * onscreen windows before we can choose a suitable fbconfig and
 * create a GLContext.
 *
 * TODO: continue this thought process and come to a decision...
